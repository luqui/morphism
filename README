Morphism is an experimental, purely functional programming language.  It is not
sure what it is experimenting with just yet, but at the very least, the
following principles are being toyed with:

(1) Extensional:  There are *no* intensional objects, as seen in
basically every language ever, created with C-syntax "keyword Name"
declarators:

    data Foo = Foo | Bar
    class Baz a where
    module Moo where

All of the above have intension, meaning you cannot replace them with
their definition because their name (+ scope) is part of the definition.
This makes them much harder to abstract over.

(2) Uniform abstraction:  Hitchhiking on the extensional property, every
kind of object can be passed to and returned from lambdas.  Further,
repeated code can *always* be beta converted out.  This seems to imply
that there are some untyped lambdas, because you can't give a type to
everything that is conceivable to factor out.

(3) Everything is serializable.  It is nonsense for a purely functional
language not to have this property.  I mean, come on.

(4) The database of everything:  Purely functional languages have the
marvelous property that, because you have to state all your inputs and
outputs explicitly, that every piece of code -- every function, helper
function, type, ...  -- can be reused.  Unfortunately no popular
(haha... popular) languages have mechanisms which permit such obvious
and painless reuse of code.  So I would like some sort of databasey or
Udony thing which really facilitates code reuse *at all scales*.  Not
just large, encapsualted libraries, but at the miniature abstract data
type with a few operations level, down to the one-liner level.
